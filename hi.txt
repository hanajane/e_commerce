Good day!

I'm a starting up small time tech business looking for reliable suppliers. i need fresh unique and affordable gadgets for my online shop like cameras, accessories, tech wise etc..
wondering if you have price range min orders?

how does it work for you in pricing, volume and orders procedure with a whole seller client like me?

I'm looking forward to do business with your company.
